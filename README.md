# Reinforced Learning- An Introduction (2nd Edition)
#### By Andrew Barto and Richard S. Sutton


This repository contains the work of my self-study of the textbook Reinforced Learning by Barto and Sutton.  
Under the Julia folder, you will find my code for the coding problems found throughout the textbook.  The solutions folder contains my detailed PDF solutions for the rest of the exercises found throughout the book.  I plan to add new content and update old content as I work my way through the textbook.  

Disclaimer: Some of the answers found in my solution keys *may* not be correct- so utilize any solutions found here with caution.  The plan is to revisit past problems as I progress through the book to converge on a thorough and correct solution.
